# Finding Eigenvectors by Dot Product

**What is the meaning of eigenvalues and eigenvectors?**
<br/>
Eigenvalues are the special set of scalar values that is associated with the set of linear equations most probably in the matrix equations. The eigenvectors are also termed as characteristic roots. It is a non-zero vector that can be changed at most by its scalar factor after the application of linear transformations.

**According to Wikipedia:**
<br/>
In linear algebra, an eigenvector or characteristic vector of a linear transformation is a nonzero vector that changes at most by a scalar factor when that linear transformation is applied to it. The corresponding eigenvalue, often denoted by Î», is the factor by which the eigenvector is scaled.

Geometrically, an eigenvector, corresponding to a real nonzero eigenvalue, points in a direction in which it is stretched by the transformation and the eigenvalue is the factor by which it is stretched. If the eigenvalue is negative, the direction is reversed. Loosely speaking, in a multidimensional vector space, the eigenvector is not rotated.
